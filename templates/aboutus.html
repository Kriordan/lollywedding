    <p class="AboutUs-story">
        It started as an ordinary night in November of 2007 when Holly & Lenny first met. The two would frequent the local bar, Goody Glovers with a group of mutual friends for cheap drinks and mediocre Irish pub fare. Their worlds came together through an appreciation for music, dancing and whiskey ginger ale cocktails. Holly’s love for Massachusetts and Lenny’s New York pride gave the couple the magnetism they were looking for in a significant other. Boston was just the start of their story. After graduating from Suffolk University, the love birds flew the coop and headed cross country to South Lake Tahoe, California. For several months they would enjoy the breath taking views and perfect snow conditions alongside great friends and fellow adventure seekers. As their Tahoe adventure came to an end, they set their sights on New York City. They planted their feet in the ridiculously diverse neighborhood of Astoria, Queens where they would learn the webs and flows of the big city. They had a beautiful beta fish, “Puppy”, (may he rest in peace) and later got their adorable, stubborn, fart filled Frenchie, Hamlet. The couple was now a family and the family decided it was time for another move. They found a beautiful one­bedroom apartment and moved on up to Long Island City. With views of the Empire State Building and the East River just down the street, the couple fell more in love with the city and each other. Holly, Lenny and Hammy were in New York for almost 5 years when they decided to head back to where it all began, Boston. The couple now resides in Jamaica Plain, playing tennis on the weekends, and bringing Hamlet on long walks through the Arnold Arboretum. Lenny popped the big question just a day after Christmas while the Whiteside family was vacationing in Asheville, North Carolina. They are extremely glad and thankful for the life they have created together and wonder with excitement what the next steps will bring.

    <div class="AboutUs-realstory">
        <p class="AboutUs-story">This is a tale of two lovers. Their story begins in a seedy college bar,
        two beers past too many. A pun with perfect confident delivery provoked a
        laugh and a smile to signify a lifetime together. Lenny and Holly, Holly
        and Lenny, Lolly Forever. The rock doves of Valhalla laid a divine riff
        that evening. A marker for one of time's greatest moments; the gods shred
        all the gnar to this epic testament. After shattering the fabric of reality
        then fusing it back together again with their solar passion, the spices of
        their relationship simmered and matured into the magnum opus of the human
        race. With the grace of the great winged creatures, Leonardo swept Holly off
        her feet into the next chapter of the given status quo. Little did anyone know
        that this is exactly as He had planned. Planned since he was a twinkle in
        that brute's eyes. Booger indeed, he would stick it to everyone. Hamlet the
        loose-cheeked snorter, laid every brick in the construction of this ruse. The
        world was blinded by the awesomeness of the union between deities, oblivious
        to the
        snakey-snake moves by the salsa master of doom. All the carrots will be his
        and the world is helpless but to sit back and watch. Carry the image of Lolly
        in your minds, for the reality of Hamlet's world will be sinister enough to
        blacken the hearts of the purest souls.</p>
